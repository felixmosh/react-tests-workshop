# Rreact Typescript Boilerplate

A very simple minimal boilerplate for React with TypeScript.

1. Get the sourcecode:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/dashtinejad/react-typescript-boilerplate.git
    ```

2. Switch to its directory:

    ```
    $ cd react-typescript-boilerplate
    ```

3. Run `npm install` command, it will install dependencies:

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

4. Run `npm run build` command, it will build the bundle for you:

    ```
    $ npm run build
    ```

5. Host the server with `webpack-dev-server`:

    ```
    $ npm run start
    ```

6. Now you can browse your site through this address:

    ```
    http://localhost:8080/
    ```
